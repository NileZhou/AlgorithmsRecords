I am an algorithm beginner, while I'm learning the algorithms, I am always amazed by the performance of some algorithm 
masters -- It seems that they don't need to think given an algorithm problem.

I guess they are masters of these two tasks:
- disassemble the problem quickly and come up with one or more possible solution
- **transform the solution into code snippets that they are familiar with and implement it quickly**

This repository is to handle the problem: 
## Collect those helpful code snippets that need to be practice over and over again.

Look forward to your suggestion. Welcome to join us!
